# ToDo App

## Description

This is a simple ToDo application built with React using TypeScript and SCSS. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage.

## Technologies

- **React**: The core framework used to build the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript, ensuring code quality and robustness.
- **SCSS**: For styling, providing a modular and maintainable CSS structure.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects within functional components.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited after being added.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed from the list.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
